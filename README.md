A simple and interactive command-line To-Do List application built using Python. This project helps users manage their daily tasks by allowing them to add, view, and delete tasks easily.


🎯 Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project is to:

Practice Python fundamentals
Understand loops, lists, and conditionals
Learn how to build a menu-driven program
Improve user input handling and validation
It’s a beginner-friendly project that builds strong programming logic.


⚙️ Features
✅ Add new tasks
✅ View all saved tasks
✅ Delete completed or unwanted tasks
✅ Input validation for safer user interaction
✅ Runs continuously until the user chooses to exit


🖥️ How the Application Works
When the program runs, the user sees a menu with four options:

 
--- TO DO APP ---
1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Delete Task
4. Exit

1️⃣ Add Task
The user can enter a new task, which gets stored in a list.

2️⃣ View Tasks
Displays all current tasks in numbered format.
If no tasks exist, the program informs the user.

3️⃣ Delete Task
The user selects a task number to remove it from the list.
The program checks for:

Valid number input
Task number within range
4️⃣ Exit
Closes the application safely.


🧠 Concepts Used
This project demonstrates:

while loops (for continuous running)
Lists (to store tasks)
Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
User input handling
String checking with .isdigit()
List operations like .append() and .pop()
Basic error handling

🚀 How to Run the Project
Make sure Python is installed on your system (Python 3 recommended).
Save the file as something like:
 
todo_app.py

Open terminal or command prompt in the file location.
Run the program:
 
python todo_app.py


📌 Example Output
 
--- TO DO APP ---
1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Delete Task
4. Exit
enter your choice(1-4): 1
enter a new task which u want: Finish homework
Added task successfully


🔮 Future Improvements
Here are some ideas to make the project more advanced:

💾 Save tasks to a file so they remain after closing the app
✏️ Add an Edit Task feature
🗂 Add task categories (Work, Study, Personal)
⏰ Add deadlines for tasks
🖼 Build a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
